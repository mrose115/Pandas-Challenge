# Pandas-Challenge - Heroes of Pymoli

This project consists of analyzing purchasing data for a free-to-play game and breaking down the data into meaningful insights. The first part of the project was to read in a CSV file and from there to gather insights for the following:

    Player Count

    Purchasing Analysis

    Gender Demographics

    Purchasing Analysis (Gender)

    Age Demographics

    Top Spenders

    Most Popular Items

    Most Profitable Items

After the analysis was completed, written observations were made based on trends in the data.

Here are screenshots of the observations:
